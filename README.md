## SIEM Data Analysis
This is an extension of a project I completed a few months ago, being the creation of my own SIEM in Microsoft Azure. You can view details about it on my LinkedIn page [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jleites356/)

I exported the data collected from the SIEM into the form of a massive spreadsheet with 30,000 different attacks documented (there were way more than 30,000 attacks but Azure only allows exports of up to 30,000). I don't want the process to be too easy, as I really desire to learn data analytics, a field that I still am not the most familiar with and have not touched since my freshman year in Data 101. Because of this, I want to strictly use coding as I feel like it would be good for my development as someone who aspires to work in tech, so platforms like Excel or Tableu will not be used in this analysis. My language of choice to tackle this spreadsheet will be Python, as with every passing year I feel more and more comfortable working with programming languages, and the language I use the least as a whole is Python. It is worth mentioning, however, that I do have experience coding in R from Data 101 all those years ago, so I'm guessing that data analysis in Python will be very similar to what I did with R. I'm not too sure, but I guess we'll see how it goes...
