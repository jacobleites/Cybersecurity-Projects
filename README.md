Using Microsoft Azure, I was able to create an online virtual machine that hackers would be able to find and attempt to intercept. Their attempts would be recorded into a log file on the virtual machine, where details of the attack would be obtained using an external API (latitude, longitude, country, etc.) that I could forward over into Log Analytics Workspace in Azure and use the necessary tools to sort out the information into their distinct columns, similar to an Excel sheet. Using this information, I would use Microsoft Sentinel to create a map and plot the districts where the attempted breaches occurred and how many. My next step with this project is to extract the data I have obtained from it once I reach enough attempted breaches and analyze it to see if I find any interesting patterns.
